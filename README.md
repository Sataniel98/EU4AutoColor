# EU4 AutoColor
EU4 AutoColor is a map modding tool for Paradox' Europa Universalis IV.

It handles the registration of provinces in the "definition.csv" file
and ensures that new provinces get unused IDs and province map colors.

To get started, add the definition.csv file of your mod or an unmodified one
to the same directory as the EU4AC jar file.
The modified output will be saved in a new file.
